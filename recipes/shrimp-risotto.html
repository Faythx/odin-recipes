        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A wonderfully rich and creamy shrimp risotto that is worth the attention to detail.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds large shrimp in their shells</li>
            <li>6 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) packages arborio rice</li>
            <li>2 large shallots, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>6 saffron threads, crumbled</li>
            <li>2 cups grated parmesean cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and devein shrimp, reserving shells. Heat stock in a large saucepan and add shells. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Chop shrimp into bite-sized morsels. Toss with olive oil and garlic; cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Strain stock and discard shells. Keep warm on low heat.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Add shallots; cook until softened, but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add dry rice and stir until each grain is coated and starts to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Raise heat to medium. Add wine, stir and simmer until mostly evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Ladle 1/2 cup of warm stock into the rice mixture; stir constantly until stock is absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Add rosemary and saffron and another 1/2 cup of stock; stir until absorbed, about 3 minutes. Repeat with about 4 more cups of stock, 10 to 15 minutes. Add marinated shrimp to the remaining 1 cup stock; stir for 1 minute and pour mixture into the rice. Cook and stir until risotto is tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter into the risotto. Stir until creamy. Serve immediately in warmed bowls.</li>
